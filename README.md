# README

This is a small web app that I used to track bits of information across projects. There is a bit more context in [How did learning Ruby-on-Rails go?](https://abdullin.com/ruby/rails/)

The app worked well. By the end of 2020, I've accumulated ~700 notes with 1.5k attachments. Couldn't imagine keeping track of my work without it.

However, Rails felt a bit overwhelming for maintaining the project and tuning it. So in February 2021 the journal was [ported to Python](https://github.com/abdullin/py-journal).
